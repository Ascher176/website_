                        <p class="about_description">
                            I am primarily interested in systems and AI-particularly the design of efficient, 
                            reliable, and scalable computational systems that support modern machine learning 
                            workloads. I am excited by research at the intersection of operating systems, 
                            hardware-software co-design, and intelligent computation, and I hope to contribute 
                            to building systems that push the boundaries of performance and usability. 
                            Alongside my systems and AI interests, I am also deeply committed to computing 
                            education. Through several years of teaching and research in this area, I have 
                            seen the transformative impact of effective learning tools and inclusive mentorship. 
                            I hope to continue contributing to the computing education community while pursuing 
                            research that advances the capabilities and accessibility of modern computational systems.

                                I developed an AI-powered tool that analyzes the root causes of 
                                customer-reported technical issues by leveraging prompt engineering, 
                                data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques-improving model 
                                accuracy from 50% to 80%. I also built a JavaScript browser extension 
                                that integrates this tool directly into engineers' workflows, making 
                                root cause analysis faster and more accessible. In addition, I 
                                collaborated with a team at QHacks, Qualcomm's intern hackathon, where 
                                we created an AI-driven curriculum design assistant and placed 3rd overall.
